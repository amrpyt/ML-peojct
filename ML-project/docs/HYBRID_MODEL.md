# Hybrid Model Improvements Guide

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model and how to use them effectively.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced CNN Architecture
- **Deeper Network**: Increased from 2 to 3 convolutional layers
- **Filter Progression**: 64 -> 128 -> 256 filters
- **Better Feature Extraction**: Added BatchNormalization and proper padding
- **Sequence Preservation**: Improved handling of temporal features

### 2. Optimized BiLSTM Layers
- **Dual BiLSTM**: Two layers (128 and 64 units)
- **Improved Memory**: Better long-term dependency handling
- **Regularization**: Strategic dropout (0.3) between layers
- **Sequence Management**: Proper sequence handling throughout network

### 3. Dense Layer Optimization
- **Larger Layers**: 128 -> 64 units progression
- **Better Training**: Added BatchNormalization
- **Regularization**: Optimized dropout rates
- **Output Layer**: Properly scaled for classification

## Usage Guide

### Training the Improved Model
1. Run `improved_hybrid_model.ipynb`:
```python
# The notebook will:
- Load and preprocess data
- Create and train the improved model
- Save the trained model
```

### Comparing Model Performance
1. Run `hybrid_model_comparison.ipynb`:
```python
# The notebook will:
- Load both original and improved models
- Compare performance metrics
- Visualize improvements
```

### Expected Improvements
- Higher accuracy on test set
- Better feature extraction
- Improved temporal pattern recognition
- More stable training process

## Performance Metrics
Monitor these metrics in the comparison notebook:
- Classification accuracy
- F1 score
- Confusion matrix
- Training stability
- Model efficiency

## Tips for Best Results
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure proper scaling of input features
   - Use SMOTE for class balancing if needed

2. **Training Process**:
   - Monitor training curves
   - Use early stopping callback
   - Adjust learning rate if needed

3. **Model Tuning**:
   - Adjust dropout rates if overfitting
   - Modify layer sizes based on your data
   - Fine-tune the number of epochs

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Check input data shape matches expected format
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Monitor memory usage during training
4. Check training logs for any warnings

## Future Improvements
Potential areas for further enhancement:
- Attention mechanisms
- Residual connections
- Advanced regularization techniques
