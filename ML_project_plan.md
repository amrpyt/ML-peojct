# ML Project Plan: Data Preprocessing, Modeling, and Optimization

This document outlines the steps to build a deep learning solution for classification and regression tasks using the provided data.

## 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Outlier Detection & Replacement**: Identify outliers in numerical columns using methods such as z-score or IQR and replace those values with statistics like mean or median (ensuring that no data is deleted).
- **Normalization**: Apply normalization or standardization to numerical features.
- **SMOTE Balancing**: Since this is a classification problem, use SMOTE to balance the classes for the 'air quality' column.

## 2. Model Training

- **Model Architectures**: Develop and train the following deep learning models:
  - 1D CNN
  - RNN
  - DNN
  - LSTM
  - BiLSTM
- **Labeling Function**: Use the provided `categorize_air_quality(value)` function to assign labels based on air quality ranges.
- **Evaluation Metrics (Classification)**: Calculate model performance using accuracy, recall, precision, and f-score.

## 3. Model Selection and Optimization

- **Select Best Model**: Identify the model with the highest accuracy from the training phase.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Improve the selected model using techniques such as:
  - Pruning
  - Quantization (including Post-Training Quantization)
  - Clustering
  - Weight Clipping
  - Knowledge Distillation
- *Note*: Apply only the techniques that are stable and beneficial.

## 4. Post-Optimization Evaluation & Regression Prediction

- **Re-Evaluate Classification**: Run the classification process again using the optimized model and measure its accuracy and efficiency.
- **Regression Task**: Use the optimized model to predict the `temp` and `hum` columns.
- **Evaluation Metrics (Regression)**: Evaluate predictions using MSE, RMSE, RÂ², and MAE.

## 5. Visualization and Reporting

- **Charts & Graphs**: Generate plots comparing results before and after key operations such as:
  - Outlier replacement
  - SMOTE balancing
  - Training (accuracy and loss curves)
- **Tables**: Create summary tables highlighting the performance metrics of the models before and after optimization.

## 6. Deployment on olabC

- Integrate the final solution with the olabC platform as required.

## 7. Process Flow Chart

- Create a simplified flowchart to illustrate the sequence of steps in the pipeline, which will serve as an overall reference for the project.
